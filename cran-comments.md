Maintenance update, also fixes check failures on Windows.

## Test environments
* local Ubuntu 17.10 install, R 3.4.3
* Ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

OK

## revdepcheck results

We checked 305 direct and indirect (depth 1) reverse dependencies (302 from CRAN + 3 from BioConductor), comparing R CMD check results across CRAN and dev versions of this package.

 * We saw 4 new problems
 * We failed to check 1 packages

Issues with CRAN packages are summarised below.

### New problems

* GSODR and unpivots: likely unrelated to the update

* tibble and hms
  now breaking because tests rely on output generated by pillar, will update soon

### Failed to check

* cdcfluview (failed to install)

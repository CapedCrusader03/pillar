Resubmission as requested by CRAN:

- Added examples to documentation
- Removed .Rd files for currently private documentation
- Fixed DESCRIPTION
- Fixed a minor problem that had escaped testing

I hope the same-version update is OK, because the originally submitted version never went public.

## Test environments
* local Ubuntu 17.04 install, R 3.4.2
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
